# Chartlytics Js Test

My solution to a coding challenge. The challenge  can be found at https://github.com/ev2900/js-test 

## Description of Solution

- The first goal was to map the INPUT and OUTPUT data. To complete this there are two seperate API's. The first is /api/upload with POST, PUT, DELETE functionality. The second api is /api/get with only GET functionality. On GET this route maps the INPUT and OUTPUT data entered into the Mongo database (/localhost/chartalytics) with the /api/upload API.
